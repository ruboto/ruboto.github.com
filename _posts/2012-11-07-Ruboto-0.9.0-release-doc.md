Ruboto (JRuby on Android) is a platform for developing full stand-alone apps for
Android using the Ruby language and libraries.  It includes support libraries
and generators for creating projects, classes, tests, and more.  The complete
APIs of Android, Java, and Ruby is available to you using the Ruby language.

New in version 0.9.0:

This release introduces the ability for Ruby classes to directly subclass Java classes.

You need JRuby 1.7.0 or later included in your project. Generate your project with

* Issue #257 Stop support for updating projects with Android SDK 13 and older directly
* Issue #272 Add --force option to "ruboto gen app"

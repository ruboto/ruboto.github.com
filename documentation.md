# Getting started

## Requirements

* Install the JDK if it's not on your system already
* Install jruby if you don't already have it. JRuby has a very easy
  install process, or you can use rvm
* Install the Android SDK
* Add the sdk to `$ANDROID_HOME` as an absolute path (Java does not expand
  tildes `~`)
* Add the sdk's `tools/` and `platform-tools/` directory to your `$PATH`
* Generate an Emulator image unless you want to develop using your
  phone.

## Installation

`gem install ruboto`
